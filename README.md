# WaveRider - An Endless Runner Game

## Overview

A fun endless runner game where players steer a small boat to navigate through obstacles such as rocks of different sizes and barrels, and collect coins and gems. Featuring smooth controls, nice water effects, and procedurally generated environments, this game offers a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. 
This is my most recent project which is still a not completly finished.
